## Details:

#### What this repo is about, and how it was made
- 🚀 This is fleshed out MVP website front-end overhaul for a pet consulting service, Paradigm Pet Professionals. <br>
- 🤢 The original site used out-dated web 1.0 design aesthetics and the entire site was filled with misaligned images and broken links. <br>
- 🎨 I re-created their front-end complete with new images and a clean, responsive layout in a neo-brutalist design. <br>
- ⚙ I created the site strictly with HTML, CSS, and JS written by myself. No libraries or frameworks. <br>



#### Reasoning behind my choices
- 🚀 I prefer to use low-fidelity mockups and jump right into programming to get a feel for what looks good if a design is not handed to me, this allows me to get the initial MVP out faster and iterate faster. <br>
- ⚙  I also created custom classes in JavaScript to handle the interactivity of the photo galleries you will find on some of the pages, and the header navigation.

#### Market Research and UI / UX testing 
In addition, I also created:
- A PDF with my initial project proposal, emphasizing stakeholder and user needs.
- The original low-fidelity mockup files created in Figma.
- A Flowchart of the site.

#### Lessons Learned
- How to more effectively communicate with stakeholders.
- How to identify what users and stakeholders need more effectively. 
- How to more effectively handle responsive web pages and refactor old web pages.
- How to better create neo-brutalist designs.
