                        Cats were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in the
                        western Asia region and are currently the second most
                        popular domestic pet in the United States. While there
                        are over 60 unique documented cat breeds, care and diet
                        can differ between breeds. However, some diets and
                        practices are generally recommended for the well-being
                        of your fluffy family member regardless of breed.

                        It is important the queen (a term commonly used for a
                        female cat that is either pregnant or nursing) directly
                        nurse her young if possible. Monitor your kitten’s
                        growth closely to make sure its growth rate is
                        progressing steadily.</p>

                    <p>
                        If any kitten is not growing at a
                        sufficient rate, a caretaker might need to feed the
                        kitten directly either with a bottle or a feeding tube.
                        Some reasons why kittens might not gain weight
                        appropriately include the following:

                        Kittens can start being introduced to soft wet kitten
                        food typically around three to four weeks after birth.
                        According to the ASPCA, kittens at this age should eat
                        half to one cup of dry kitten food or six to nine ounces
                        of wet kitten food per day. If your kitten has
                        difficulties eating hard food, a small amount of water
                        can be added to soften the food.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Cat food that is
                        optimized for kittens provides the additional nutrients
                        that are needed for growth, energy, and wellness.
                        Depending on the breed, your cat may have different
                        dietary requirements. You should always consult with
                        your veterinarian for recommendations.

                        This age is when kittens reach the cat stage and do not
                        need as many nutrients. At this age, their level of
                        activity decreases, and so does their metabolism.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It is
                        not recommended to leave food out for the cats all day.
                        Instead, provide food a couple times a day so they eat
                        meals rather than snacking throughout the day. This
                        practice reduces the risk of obesity and other
                        weight-related feline ailments.

                        Much like many living organisms, the body begins to
                        deteriorate and experience a lot of changes. Cats at
                        this age should eat less fats and calories and more
                        quality proteins.

                    <p>
                        This means when you are purchasing
                        packaged foods for your cat, look for food that states a
                        particular protein (such as "salmon") and not just a
                        category (such as fish). This usually means they are
                        byproducts, or combinations, of lesser quality proteins.
